description: Display a RevenueCat paywall inside an app using the RevenueCatUI SDK. Use when the user asks to add a paywall, show a RevenueCat paywall, present PaywallView, integrate RevenueCatUI, gate a premium screen with a paywall, launch PaywallActivity, call presentPaywall or presentPaywallIfNeeded, or show the dashboard configured paywall UI on iOS, Android, Kotlin Multiplatform, Flutter, or React Native.

# revenuecat-paywall: display a RevenueCat paywall

Use this skill when the user wants to show a paywall that is built and configured in the RevenueCat dashboard, using the native RevenueCatUI components. This skill does not cover building a custom paywall from scratch. For that, use `revenuecat-purchase-flow` (when available) and `Purchases.getOfferings(…)` directly.

Prerequisite: `integrate-revenuecat` has already run. `Purchases.configure(…)` must succeed before a paywall can load.

## 1. Detect the platform

Inspect the working directory and pick the **first** match, from top to bottom:

1. **React Native**: `package.json` has a `react-native-purchases` entry, or `react-native` as a dependency. `react-native-purchases-ui` is the paywall package. Read `platforms/react-native.md`. If `expo` is also a dependency, note it as an Expo project.
2. **Flutter**: `pubspec.yaml` exists at the project root. The paywall package is `purchases_ui_flutter`. Read `platforms/flutter.md`.
3. **Kotlin Multiplatform**: `build.gradle.kts` contains a `kotlin { … }` multiplatform source sets block, or depends on `com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-kmp*`. The paywall module is `purchases-kmp-ui`. Read `platforms/kmp.md`.
4. **Android (native)**: `build.gradle(.kts)` applies `com.android.application` (and is not KMP). The paywall dependency is `com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-ui`. Read `platforms/android.md`.
5. **iOS (native)**: `Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, or `Podfile` at the project root. The paywall product is `RevenueCatUI`. Read `platforms/ios.md`.

If several match (e.g. an `ios/` folder inside a Flutter project), pick the **outermost** project, the one that owns the build. If still ambiguous, ask the user which platform they want to configure.

## 2. Shared concepts (all platforms)

- **Paywalls require an Offering with a paywall attached in the RevenueCat dashboard.** The SDK pulls offerings via `getOfferings()`. If no offering has a paywall configured, RevenueCatUI falls back to a default paywall layout, which is not what you want in production.
- **Offering vs. entitlement.** Users purchase a product through a package in an offering. Access is granted via an entitlement (typically `"premium"` or `"pro"`). Gate premium features on the entitlement, not on the offering.
- **Three presentation patterns**:
  - (a) First launch modal for users without the entitlement, typically driven by a "present if needed" helper that checks the entitlement and only shows the paywall when missing.
  - (b) Gated premium screen. The user taps a premium feature and the paywall opens before the screen loads.
  - (c) Conditional present on a CTA tap, such as an "Upgrade" button in settings.
- **RevenueCatUI owns the purchase flow.** Do not call `Purchases.purchase(…)` manually alongside a RevenueCatUI paywall. The paywall calls it internally. Listen for the dismiss or purchase completed callback to react in app code.
- **Close button is opt in on most platforms.** Pass `displayCloseButton = true` (iOS / Flutter / RN) or `setShouldDisplayDismissButton(true)` (Android / KMP) when the paywall is presented modally and the user needs a way out. Skip it when presenting behind a sheet with its own grabber, or when wrapping the paywall in a navigation controller.
- **If the app needs a fully custom UI**, do not use this skill. Call `Purchases.getOfferings()` and render your own components. RevenueCatUI is only for dashboard templated paywalls.

## 3. Implementation

Read the platform file that matches detection:

- `platforms/ios.md`
- `platforms/android.md`
- `platforms/kmp.md`
- `platforms/flutter.md`
- `platforms/react-native.md`

Each platform file is self contained: install command, exact snippet to present the paywall, and the callback shape you listen to.

## 4. Verify

Do not claim the integration is complete until:

1. The project **builds** on the target platform.
2. The app launches, the code path that presents the paywall runs, and the paywall UI renders with the template configured in the dashboard (not the default fallback layout).
3. Tapping a package and completing a sandbox purchase dismisses the paywall and fires the purchase completed callback (or, for imperative APIs, resolves with a `PURCHASED` result).
4. Closing the paywall without purchasing fires the dismiss / cancelled callback.

If the paywall shows the default fallback layout instead of your template, the offering does not have a paywall attached in the dashboard. Fix this in the dashboard, then retry.
